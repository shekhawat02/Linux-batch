#Linux commands can be broadly categorized into four types based on how they are implemented and executed within the shell environment:
1.Executable Programs:
These are standalone programs or utilities stored as executable files in directories like /bin, /usr/bin, /sbin, or /usr/local/bin. When you type a command like ls, cat, or grep, the shell searches for and executes the corresponding binary file.

2.Built-in Commands:
These commands are built directly into the shell itself (e.g., Bash). They are not separate executable files but are handled internally by the shell for efficiency and to perform shell-specific operations. Examples include cd, pwd, echo, and exit.

3.Shell Functions:
Shell functions are custom blocks of code defined within the shell or sourced from a shell script. They allow you to group a series of commands and execute them with a single name, often used to create more complex or specialized commands.

4.Aliases:
Aliases are shortcuts or alternative names for existing commands or sequences of commands. They are defined within the shell to provide a more convenient or memorable way to execute frequently used commands. For example, alias ll='ls -lha' creates an alias ll that executes the ls -lha command
